This is a small project to re-create the Google homepage from scratch to demonstrate some basic proficiency in HTML and CSS.

I did my best to get this to look like the Google homepage. I had trouble with a few things such as extending the length of the search bar while the buttons stay centered beneath it.

I may redo this project and have better structure to the HTML and cleaner, ,ore organized CSS.
